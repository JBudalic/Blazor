            <h2 class="accent">Tremont Waters Hopes to Build Off of Strong Preseason</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Tremont Waters is the smallest player on the Celtics’ roster, yet he still managed to make one of the biggest impressions on Boston’s coaching staff during preseason play.
            </p>
            <p>
                Head coach Brad Stevens singled out the 5-foot-10 point guard as one of the team’s few consistent bright spots throughout its two preseason losses, particularly for his effort during the fourth quarter of Friday night’s 113-89 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I did think that our last group did a good job, and specifically orchestrated by Tremont,” Stevens pointed out following Friday’s game. “I thought he was very good really in both games in getting us organized. We can take something from how he’s led
                us.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Waters played 24 minutes across those two games, totaling 13 points, eight assists, three rebounds, and three steals, all while committing just one turnover. He also had the second-highest plus/minus rating on the team, finishing with a plus-nine despite
                Boston being outscored by a total of 33 points during preseason play.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was refreshing to see how comfortable Waters looked running the offense, especially considering the fact that he only appeared in 11 Celtics games last season. As a two-way player, he spent most of his time with the Maine Red Claws, with whom he averaged
                18.0 points, 7.3 assists, 3.2 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game, while earning G League Rookie of the Year honors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Heading into this season, the 22-year-old sophomore is hoping to gain more opportunities to prove that he is ready to contribute at the NBA level. However, he’s also being patient in his approach, knowing that every opportunity he gets will have to be
                earned.
