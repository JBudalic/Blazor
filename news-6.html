            <h2 class="accent"> Pritchard Dazzles in Pro Debut, Drops 16 Points Off Bench</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Payton Pritchard sure looked like he belonged during his NBA debut.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rookie point guard came off of Boston’s bench Tuesday night and dazzled during his first preseason game, logging 16 points, four rebounds, two assists and a blocked shot against the Philadelphia 76ers. He finished second among all Celtics reserves
                in playing time with nearly 22 minutes of action, which trailed only Grant Williams
            </p>
            <p>
                Pritchard, whom Boston selected 26th overall during the November NBA Draft, wasted no time getting into the action once his name was called with 2:51 remaining in the first quarter. On his very first possession, he crossed up his defender and drove to
                the baseline for a pullup jumper from 13 feet out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three minutes later, he strung together a sequence that featured a patient drive-and-kick to fellow point guard Jeff Teague for a 3-pointer, followed by a blocked shot against veteran Mike Scott at the other end.
            </p>
            <p>
                His early impact was a sign of what was to come the rest of the night. Pritchard made a consistent impact throughout the remainder of the contest with his poise, pace and skill. When all was said and done, Pritchard finished as the team’s second-leading
                scorer and assist man.
            </p>
            <p>
                The performance spoke volumes for the 22-year-old guard, who is just 11 days into his first training camp in the world’s most competitive basketball league.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Honestly, it was just trying to get in the flow of things,” Pritchard said his effort. “Obviously, it’s a little bit of a different game than the college level and this was my first time, so a little bit of jitters. So just really just trying to get
                a feel out there and that was pretty much it.”
