            <h2 class="accent">Celtics Push Toward Opening Night with Lofty Goals and Realistic Perspectives</h2>
            <p class="description">
                The Boston Celtics enter the 2020-21 season with a combination of lofty goals and realistic perspectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their goal, as always, is to add an 18th championship banner to the TD Garden rafters. They recognize, however, that their current state is far from championship caliber.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We have a lot of growth that has to occur on this team for this team to be good,” Brad Stevens said Tuesday afternoon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Such growth will be a work in progress throughout the first half of Boston’s season, which begins Wednesday night when it plays host to the Milwaukee Bucks.
            </p>
            <p>
                It may be months before the Celtics and the rest of the league truly know what type of team is donning the green and white this season. The one that took the court for two underwhelming preseason performances, and the one that will take the court for
                the first few weeks of the regular season, is not anywhere close to whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                All-Star point guard Kemba Walker has yet to practice with the team due to his ongoing program to strengthen his left knee, and frontcourt newcomer Tristan Thompson missed both preseason games with a right hamstring strain. Walker is “still a long way
                away” from returning to practice, according to Stevens, and Thompson just practiced with the team for the first time Saturday afternoon. His availability for Wednesday’s season opener is still uncertain.
