            <h2 class="accent"> Nesmith Reflects on Debut: ‘I'd Been Looking Forward to It’</h2>
            <p class="description">
                BOSTON – Celtics rookie marksman Aaron Nesmith on Tuesday night played in his first competitive basketball game in 342 days. It took him all of 45 seconds to shake off any shooting cobwebs that may have accumulated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nesmith, who hadn’t played since Jan. 8 when he was a sophomore at Vanderbilt University, entered Boston’s preseason opener in Philadelphia at the 7:07 mark of the third quarter. On just his second career offensive possession, the 21-year-old caught a
                pass in the left corner, took one dribble toward the wing, and knocked down step-back triple over the outstretched hand of All-Defensive First Team guard Ben Simmons.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It was fun just getting out there to play with my teammates and play the game of basketball at a high level again,” Nesmith reflected Wednesday afternoon after returning home to Boston. “It's just something I'd been looking forward to for a long time.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Nesmith finished the night with eight points, five rebounds (two offensive), one assist, and one block during 19 minutes of turnover-free action. His other two buckets came in the form of a put-back layup and a post-up floater, both of which were eye-catching
                scoring methods for a guy whom many had labeled as a sharpshooting specialist heading into the Draft after shooting 52.2 percent from deep last season at Vanderbilt.
            </p>
            <p>
                “As time goes on, definitely trying and expand my game and expand my arsenal and just become a better basketball player,” Nesmith said when asked of the post-up shot in particular.
            </p>
            <p>
                As time goes on, Nesmith will also grow more comfortable within the Celtics system. In the beginning, however, it may be challenging for both he and fellow rookie Payton Pritchard, who dazzled with 16 points during the exhibition opener, considering how
                neither of them went through the typical summer buildup that most rookies experience.
