            <p>
                The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's
                original eight teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Boston Bruins.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Celtics are regarded as one of the most successful basketball teams in NBA history; the franchise is tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for most NBA Championships won with 17 (accounting for 23.6 percent of all NBA championships since the league's founding)
                and currently holds the record for the most recorded wins of any NBA team.The Celtics are one of the two charter BAA franchises (the other is the New York Knicks) still playing in their original city.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, which was heavily highlighted throughout the 1960s and 1980s. During the two teams many match-ups in the 1980s, the Celtics star, Larry Bird, and the Lakers star, Magic Johnson, had an ongoing
                feud. The franchise has played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals (including their most recent appearances in 2008 and 2010), of which the Celtics have won nine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Celtics rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after coach Red Auerbach acquired center Bill Russell, who would become the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty, in a draft day trade in 1956. Led by Russell and superstar point guard Bob Cousy, the
                Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, K. C. Jones, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics
                into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships throughout the 1960s.
